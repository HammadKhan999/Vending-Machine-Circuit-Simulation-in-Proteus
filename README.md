# Vending-Machine-Circuit-Simulation-in-Proteus
design and simulate a circuit for a vending machine using
switches, lamps (LEDs) and seven segment displays. The following design
specifications are to be followed:
1. The vending machine takes two types of inputs, coins and choice of
product.
2. The vending machine should accept and differentiate between different
money denominations. Assume that there are only 1, 2, 5 and. The
different type of coins can be denoted by four different switches.
3. This machine sells 3 different type of products, each with different
prices. None of the products can cost exactly 1, 2, 5. Choice of product
can be indicated by toggle switches. Users are only allowed to purchase
1 product at a time.
4. Two types of outputs are generated by the vending machine; indication of product purchased and the amount of change that needs to be
returned.
5. One out of 3 LEDs for each product should light up indicating a successful purchase. Another LED should light up if the input money is
less than the price of any desired product.
6. The amount of change that needs to be returned must be displayed on
7 segment displays.
7. Once the money credited to the user is returned, the vending machine
should be able to reset the money counter while triggering an LED
to indicate change has been returned. A new product could then be
purchased.
8. The vending machine design should be able to keep track of inventory
in the machine. It can be assumed that in the initial state, the machine
is full and there are five items for each of the 3 selections.
